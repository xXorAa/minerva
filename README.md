Minerva VERY Unofficial
=======================

There is nothing "official" about this repo, its just a backup of my
playing with the code. Although you can build some byte exact release
versions from it.

See [Marcel Kilgus'](https://www.kilgus.net/ql/minerva/) pages and/or
[Dilwyn's](http://dilwyn.me/uk) pages for more information and official
distribution.

If you file an issue I probably cant fix it as I'm very rusty at 68k
assembler so don't be surprised if its just closed.

But if you find anything useful feel free to nick it, no need to ask!
